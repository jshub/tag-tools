h1. New developments

After a relatively quiet three year period Microformats are again receiving attention, with new microformats being proposed, and Microsoft, Yahoo and Mozilla all announcing new initiatives.

Meanwhile Google have also been pushing for cross vendor standardization of metadata for some of its products to enable backend data-sharing.

Yahoo has placed microformats at the core of its Yahoo! Open Strategy (Y!OS)[1] and SearchMonkey[2] developer tools.

h2. Browsers

Both Firefox 3.1 and IE8 are expected to features some native support for microformats, however the exact behavior and developer API it not yet know.

h2. Extensions

Mozilla have long had a relationship with IBM researchers, with a number of Semantic and Microformat orientated extensions being contributed, along with core HTML support for Accessibility clients. The most feature rich is Operator[3], on which future Firefox native support for microformats in extensions and web pages is planned.

More recently Mix Online (with Microsoft) have released Oomph[4], an IE Toolbar plugin and standalone Javascript library (based on jQuery) for exposing microformats on sites. This is expected to support the release of IE8 and its native support for hSlices[5] (an extension to hAtom) and possibly others.

h3. hProduct

Prototyped at BestBuy this has now become a Microformats.org proposal[6], and is compatible and combinable with the existing hListing and hReview.

BestBuy have integrated it with their internal search  ("example":http://www.bestbuy.com/shop/tv+samsung+1080p) as well as their Giftag service and browser extension and they have committed to:

bq. In the near future, Giftag will contribute and maintain an open source hProduct studio application built using jQuery...

<textarea name="code" class="HTML" cols="60" rows="1">
<div class="hproduct">
   <h4 class="name">The Pick of Destiny</h4>
   <h5 class="p-v">by <span class="property artist">Tenacious D</span></h5>
   <p class="description summary">The Pick of Destiny is the highly 
   anticipated soundtrack to the upcoming New Line Cinema comedy, Tenacious
   D in the Pick of Destiny. An epic musical adventure, the film follows

</textarea>

This microformat is of particular interest for use in making recommendations.

h2. hSlices

Still under development by Microsoft for IE8 the purpose of an hSlice is to allow for the subscribing to partial content in a page in a similar manner as for a RSS feed. As a result the hSlice microformat is based on hAtom and has provoked much discussion in the Microformats community about its implementation.

A common example is to subscribe to a webpage widget that displays the temperature:

<textarea name="code" class="HTML" cols="60" rows="1">
<div class="hslice" id="main">
    <h2 class="entry-title">Seattle Weather</h2>
    <p>It is currently <span class="entry-title">62&deg;</span>.</p>
</div>
</textarea>

This microformat is of particular interest for use in AJAX content updates.
