h1. Quick history of the Semantic Web

Microformats are not the only solution for providing *more intelligent data* on the web, and are not even new - original ideas and implementations have been around since at least 1997 and are not likely to go away. 

Alternative approaches exist, and many have been under development even longer - in many cases predating the Internet with a strong academic grounding. 

Collectively all these are known as the Semantic Web and it is a *huge* *ongoing* research area.

h2. The Semantic Web

The intent derives from W3C(World Wide Web Consortium) director Sir Tim Berners-Lee's vision of the Web as a universal medium for data, information, and knowledge exchange:

bq. I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web - the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A 'Semantic Web', which should make this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The '*intelligent agents*' people have touted for ages will finally materialize. (Tim Berners-Lee, 1999)

However a proper solution to this vision requires huge effort, including dealing with complicated domains such as *identity, trust and security*, as well as large scale co-ordination and adoption by all interested parties both on and off the internet to be useful. 

Here is an example of the current scope of a Semantic Web Architecture and the technologies involved:

h2. The adoption problem

One advocate of microformats characterized a problem with the alternative approaches:

bq. Here's a new language we want you to learn, and now you need to output these additional files on your server. It's a hassle. (Microformats) lower the barrier to entry. (Tantek Celik)

As such microformats have specific design principles aimed at encouraging adoption by content creators and end users:

* *Reduce*: favor the simplest solutions and focus attention on specific problems.
* *Reuse*: work from experience and favor examples of current practice.
* *Recycle*: encourage modularity and the ability to embed - valid XHTML can be reused in blog posts, RSS feeds, and anywhere else you can access the web.

Microformats are not a replacement for the Semantic Web, but they do move things in the right direction, and for many usecases provide a majority of benefits now for minimal effort.
