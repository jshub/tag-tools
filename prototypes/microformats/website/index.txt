h2. The basics

A microformat is a web-based approach to semantic markup that seeks to re-use existing XHTML and HTML tags to convey metadata and other attributes. This approach allows information intended for end-users (such as contact information, geographic coordinates, calendar events, and the like) to also be automatically processed by software.

This is a similar technique as those used for SEO(Search Engine Optimization) and Accessibility techniques.

h2. Demonstration of usage

In this example, the contact information is presented as follows:

h3. Inaccessible

<textarea name="code" class="HTML" cols="60" rows="1">
  <img alt="" src="images/example_phonenumber.gif"/>
</textarea>

!images/example_phonenumber.gif!

h3. Non semantic

<textarea name="code" class="HTML" cols="60" rows="1">
 <div>
   <div>Joe Doe</div>
   <div>The Example Company</div>
   <div>604-555-1234</div>
   <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>
 </div>
</textarea>

h3. Semantic

With hCard microformat markup, that becomes:

<textarea name="code" class="HTML" cols="60" rows="1">
 <div class="vcard">
   <div class="fn">Joe Doe</div>
   <div class="org">The Example Company</div>
   <div class="tel">604-555-1234</div>
   <a class="url" href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>
 </div>
</textarea>

Here, the formatted name (fn), organization (org), telephone number (tel) and web address (url) have been identified using specific class names and the whole thing is wrapped in <code>class="vcard"</code>, which indicates that the other classes form an <acronym title="HTML vCard"><span class="caps">hCard</span></acronym> and are not merely coincidentally named. Other, optional, hCard classes also exist. 

It is now possible for software, such as browser plug-ins or search engines, to extract the information, and transfer it to other applications, such as an address book.
